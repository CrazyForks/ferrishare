Building a full-stack web-app has more moving parts than one might think.
Still to do:

- [x] Complete core functionality
  - [x] Download FE and BE
  - [x] Delete FE (modal) and BE
  - [x] Admin overview page
    - [ ] Pagination on the admin overview?
  - [x] Actually deleting expired files
- [ ] Packaging the whole thing in a configurable Docker container
  - [ ] Ensure the actual db, config and uploaded files live in their own directory.
- [ ] Check that uploads are indeed encrypted (entropy and magic number(?) checks).
- [ ] Ensure that uploaded files are immediately streamed to disk instead of memory.
- [x] Correct tracing / logging
- [x] Correct error handling
  - [x] Obiously we need super robus endpoints, but I also want to ensure the client gets expressive error messages that will actually help them
- [ ] Proper theming
  - [ ] The whole app is B/W currently - that needs to improve
  - [ ] subset the icon font, maybe remove the ligatures, and definitely remove them from the accessibility tree
  - [ ] run lighthouse on the final app to iron out any kinks
- [ ] Set up WAL mode on sqlite and other possible settings
- [x] Proper app configuration
  - [x] IP and PORT that we're binding on
    - [ ] Special considerations for IPv6 support?
  - [ ] Rate Limit Settings
    - [ ] No. of requests per IP, No. of uploads per IP
  - [ ] REVERSE PROXY SETTINGS
    - [ ] The WebCrypto-API *requires* a secure context, meaning this site has to be served over HTTPS
    - [ ] Maybe we'll add TLS support in the server, but really, we should reverse proxy this thing
    - [ ] Trusted IPs for X-Forwarded-For, and also properly integrating that header, ofc
  - [x] Maximum allowed filesize
    - [ ] Remember, we need to adjust the maximum allowed request length in axum, too.
  - [x] File quota
    - [ ] This still needs to be implemented, btw
  - [x] Some kind of setup routine where the admin can set the ADMIN PASSWORD.
- [ ] Rate Limiting
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Code-level documentation, both within and outside of code
  - [ ] General development documentation
  - [ ] Usage documentation
    - [ ] How to install, how to configure
- [ ] Marketing page / README
  - [ ] What this is, what it does
  - [ ] feature list
  - [ ] screenshots / screen recordings showcasing how the app looks and what it does
  - [ ] Might be a good idea to make GitHub the proper home for this since we'll probably want to accept contributions and issues.
  - [ ] Add it to awesome selfhosted, announce it on reddit / lemmy once finished.
- [ ] Demo Mode and Host
  - [ ] We need a running demo of this.
  - [ ] Maybe with restrictions on retention and who's allowed to download files, to prevent abuse.
