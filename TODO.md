Building a full-stack web-app has more moving parts than one might think.
Still to do:

- Complete core functionality
  - Download FE and BE
  - Delete FE (modal) and BE
  - Admin overview page
    - Pagination on the admin overview?
  - Actually deleting expired files
- Packaging the whole thing in a configurable Docker container
- Check that uploads are indeed encrypted (entropy and magic number(?) checks).
- Correct tracing / logging
  - Perhaps into a dedicated file, perhaps into STDOUT so docker (compose) can pick it up
- Correct error handling
  - Obiously we need super robus endpoints, but I also want to ensure the client gets expressive error messages that will actually help them
- Proper theming
  - The whole app is B/W currently - that needs to improve
- Proper app configuration
  - There's lots of variables that need configuring, unify all of this.
  - URL/HOSTNAME on which we're running
  - IP and PORT that we're binding on
    - Special considerations for IPv6 support?
  - Rate Limit Settings
    - No. of requests per IP, No. of uploads per IP
  - REVERSE PROXY SETTINGS
    - The WebCrypto-API *requires* a secure context, meaning this site has to be served over HTTPS
    - Maybe we'll add TLS support in the server, but really, we should reverse proxy this thing
    - Trusted IPs for X-Forwarded-For, and also properly integrating that header, ofc
  - Maximum allowed filesize
    - Remember, we need to adjust the maximum allowed request length in axum, too.
  - Some kind of setup routine where the admin can set the ADMIN PASSWORD.
- Rate Limiting
- Documentation
  - Code-level documentation, both within and outside of code
  - General development documentation
  - Usage documentation
    - How to install, how to configure
- Marketing page / README
  - What this is, what it does
  - feature list
  - screenshots / screen recordings showcasing how the app looks and what it does
  - Might be a good idea to make GitHub the proper home for this since we'll probably want to accept contributions and issues.
  - Add it to awesome selfhosted, announce it on reddit / lemmy once finished.
- Demo Mode and Host
  - We need a running demo of this.
  - Maybe with restrictions on retention and who's allowed to download files, to prevent abuse.
